# a6lte kernel source backup

This is an unmodified copy of the official Android kernel sources for Samsung Galaxy A6 2018 ("a6lte"). They are uploaded solely because Samsung does not provide an endpoint for automated downloads.

All files except for this README are the contents of Kernel.tar.gz, which is within SM-A600FN_EUR_QQ_Opensource.zip, which can be downloaded [here](https://opensource.samsung.com/uploadSearch?searchValue=a600fn) (version A600FNXXU9CVB1).

Samsung has stopped official updates for this model, so its expected that these sources are the last ones released.
